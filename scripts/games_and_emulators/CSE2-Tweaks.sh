#Hey user, in case you are reading this, that means you are looking in the source code. Hi, so yeah, we like to keep this in the hope Nicalis takes the DMCA up, which,
#everyday that passes seems least likely, but well. In case you don't know, CSE2 was a open source decompilation of the game freeware indie game Doukutsu Monogatari (Cave Story), which
#was taken down with a false DMCA claim. This most likely because Cave Story +, a remaster of the original game with updgraded graphics and one or two new things
#And that is basically all the story, Nicalis never answered back, and the project ended dying with some user only sharing the saved files between them
#In case you wonder, no, its not posible to upload the files. This put us in risk of getting a DMCA ourselves. So, unless something happens, this file would stay archived forever
#- Lang 

#Oh yeah by the way - it's still totally possible to install Cave Story on your Switch here, we just haven't given it its own script.
#...since it's really only one line (assuming you have flatpak set up, which we can automate for you with the initial setup script)
#run this in your terminal: flatpak install flathub com.gitlab.coringao.cavestory-nx
#bear in mind that TEGRA DOES NOT HAVE HARDWARE ACCELERATION FOR FLATPAK
#so you're probably better off installing it from RetroPie: https://retropie.org.uk/docs/Cave-Story/
