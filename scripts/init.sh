  description="Do you want to remove the snap store? If unsure, think of it as\
  \nbloatware from Canonical\
  \nIt's controversial for a few reasons:\
  \n - the store is closed source, which is a bit weird for a Linux company...\
  \n - programs installed from them are in containers,\
  \n   which means they won't run as well\
  \n - the biggest issue, especially on a weaker device like\
  \n   the Tegra hardware you're using right now, is that\
  \n   it automatically updates snap packages whenever it wants\
  \n   to, with no input from the user - which can obviously\
  \n   slow anything you're doing at the moment down.\
  \nThat being said, if you've already been using this device for a while,\
  \nYou may want to keep it for now since you might have installed stuff\
  \nusing it. It's recommended by us to switch from snaps to apt, flatpak, and\
  \nbuilding from source whenever possible.\
  \nSo as you can probably tell, we're extremely biased against\
  \nit and would recommend removing it. But the choice is yours:\
